## Features

Feature: Dictionary Information Display
Overview
This feature caters to language learners who seek to improve their understanding of words. The application offers detailed information about selected words, such as meaning, pronunciation, and other relevant data. It is compatible with the Android platform and uses a free online dictionary API for word information retrieval.

Included UI Features
Dictionary information display: The user interface presents the retrieved dictionary data for selected words in a clear and organized manner, allowing users to easily access information such as definition, pronunciation, syllabication, and part of speech.
Multiple definitions: If multiple definitions are available for a word, the UI effectively displays all of them in a comprehensible format.
Responsive design: The UI is designed to swiftly display the requested dictionary information within 5 seconds, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Non-intrusive presentation: The user interface showcases the dictionary information in a separate section or window, allowing users to continue their interaction with the contextual example without any disruption.

Example Use Case
A user selects a word within the contextual example and taps the dictionary button. The system promptly retrieves and exhibits the word's dictionary information, including aspects like definition, pronunciation, and part of speech, in a separate section or window. This enables users to effortlessly access and comprehend the meaning and usage of the chosen word without interrupting their current engagement with the application.
