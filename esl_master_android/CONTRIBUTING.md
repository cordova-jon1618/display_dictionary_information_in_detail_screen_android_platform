Introduction
First off, thank you for considering contributing to WordCount. It's people like you that make WordCount such a great tool.
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.
Contributions we are looking for
WordCount is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into WordCount itself.
Contributions we are NOT looking for
Please, do not suggest features in any other way but via issue tracker
Please, do not create merge requests for features that haven't been listed in the issue tracker.
Ground Rules
Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
Focusing on what is best for the community
Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances

Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Responsibilities

Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Linux.
Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: //place checklist here
Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
Don't add any classes to the codebase unless needed. Err on the side of using functions.
Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the Python Community Code of Conduct.

Your First Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to WordCount? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues: Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two. Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.
Working on your first Merge Request? You can learn how from this free series, https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html
At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first ðŸ˜¸
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
Getting started
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

Create your own fork of the code
Do the changes in your fork
If you like the change and think the project could use it: * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project. * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, //CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT// *Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.
As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

Spelling / grammar fixes
Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
Comment clean up
Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
Adding logging messages or debugging output
Changes to â€˜metadataâ€™ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
Moving source files from one directory or package to another

How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email maksym.yaremenko@mask-me.net instead.
Any security issues should be submitted directly to maksym.yaremenko@mask-me.net In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at maksym.yaremenko@mask-me.net.
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

What version of Python are you using?
What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
What did you do?
What did you expect to see?
What did you see instead?

How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in WordCount, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that WordCount has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitLab which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
Code review process
The core team looks at Merge Requests on a weekly basis. If there are no problems or questions come under light during review process, merge request gets approved and then can be merged into codebase.
